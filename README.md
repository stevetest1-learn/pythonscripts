# pythonscripts
## running the fix_create_session.py from a directoy and it will create a new file with the user Input and add that to the file. 
## It will also create a back up file in the same directoy. 
## also I have added a password encryption on the password for the fix session so it is encrypted in the file and the user will not see it on the screen
